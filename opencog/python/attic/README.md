This directory contains assorted code that is not in current use.
That is, there are no subsystems that require this code. If anything
here is useful to you, please revive it!

Development of the code here halted at the end of 2015.

Contents:

* spatiotemporal: Fuzzy time interval algebra.
* blending: Concept blending.
* conceptnet: maps structure from ConceptNet into Atomese.
* graph_description: generates graphviz graphs.

Unknown, undocumented code:

* dingjie: ??? (developer snapshot)
* embodiment: ??? (almost empty directory)
* freebase: ??? (I guess maybe Freebase import??)
* learning: ??? (Three different aglos that do something unknown.)
